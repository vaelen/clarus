# CLAUDE.md

Clarus is a compiled, event-driven language for System 6/7 68k Macs.
Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` first — it is the authoritative record of sequencing
and strategy. `docs/clarus-language-reference.md` is the normative language
spec; where any other doc disagrees, the reference wins.

## Build and test

```sh
go build -o clarus ./cmd/clarus   # host toolchain: check / build / run
go test ./...                     # full suite, incl. bootstrap + snapshot tests
```

- The Go compiler (`cmd/clarus`, `internal/`) is FROZEN — it is the
  differential-testing reference only. New language features land in the
  reference + `clarusc` (the self-hosted compiler, `clarusc/*.cla`).
- `clarusc/clarusc.c` is the committed bootstrap snapshot. If
  `TestSnapshotCurrent` fails, it prints regeneration instructions.
- Bootstrap from C alone:
  `cc -I internal/build/rt -o clarusc clarusc/clarusc.c internal/build/rt/rt.c`

## Retro68 / Mac toolchain (symlinks, not in git)

- `Retro68/` → Retro68 source; Universal Interfaces in
  `Retro68/InterfacesAndLibraries`.
- `toolchain/` → built cross-toolchain (`toolchain/bin`: gcc, Rez, LaunchAPPL,
  hfsutils h* tools). Prebuilt samples: `../Retro68-build/build-target/Samples/`.
- `macplus/` → Mini vMac emulator (`MacPlus.app`) + `vMac.ROM`.

## Running Mac apps in the emulator

`~/.LaunchAPPL.cfg` is already configured (minivmac backend: `macplus/MacPlus.app`,
`macplus/vMac.ROM`, system image `~/mac/System 6.0.8.dsk`, AutoQuit at
`~/mac/macplus/autoquit-1.1.1.dsk`).

```sh
toolchain/bin/LaunchAPPL -e minivmac App.bin   # takes MacBinary (.bin)
```

- LaunchAPPL builds a stripped boot disk (System + AutoQuit + app), boots it
  in a fresh Mini vMac copy, and BLOCKS until the app quits — run it in the
  background. It creates a temp dir in the cwd (auto-removed on clean exit;
  delete it manually if you kill the process). Exit 0 = app ran and quit.
- To run an app with the full Finder instead: copy `MacPlus.app` to a scratch
  dir, put `vMac.ROM` and a bootable image as `Contents/mnvm_dat/disk1.dsk`
  (app disk as `disk2.dsk`), and `open -na` the copy. Mini vMac auto-mounts
  the `mnvm_dat` disks.

### Controlling and screenshotting the emulator

The emulator window is the Mac's 512×342 screen at 2× (1024×684 + title bar).

```sh
# window geometry {x, y, w, h}:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "minivmac" to get {position, size} of window 1'
# screenshot that region:
screencapture -x -Rx,y,w,h shot.png
# mouse (CGEvent): screen coords = window origin + 2 × Mac coords
swift scripts/click.swift <x> <y> [double]
# keyboard (focus the window first):
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set frontmost of process "minivmac" to true'
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "text"'
```

Screenshot → read the image → click at computed coords → screenshot again.
System 6 boots in ~2-3 s; sleep ~10 s after launch before interacting.

### Known issues

- Retro68's console-library samples (HelloWorld, Raytracer) crash on launch
  with system error 3 (illegal instruction) on the Mac Plus — the binary
  itself, not the launch path. Plain Toolbox apps (Dialog sample) work fine.
  Don't use the console library as a reference for whether the pipeline works.
